# leaflet-challenge

I created an earthquake visualisation from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_month.geojson.

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are larger, and earthquakes with greater depth are darker.

I created popups to provide additional information about the earthquake when it is clicked, including the date and time of the earthquake.

A colour legend provides a key to earthquake depth.
